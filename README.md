# Learning Haskell
## Lets teach myself a Haskell for a great good

I think Haskell combined with C/C++ might be the ultimate combination for me and what I'm trying to achieve. Let's see what we can do.

IÂ´ve already looked into Haskell in the past. The reason I looked into it back then was to learn how monads work and become a better F#-developer. Once my goal was achieved I left Haskell. Since then I've heard a lot of exciting stuff about Haskell like fast garbage collection, interop with C/C++, dependent types and refinement types with Liquid Haskell. So I'm curious to see what I can do with this language.

The plan is (as usual) to go through some basic features at first and provide isolated and simple examples for future reference. Then to go on to more intermediate subjects like parallellism, C interop and GUI. We'll see what advanced topics I'll explore down the line.
